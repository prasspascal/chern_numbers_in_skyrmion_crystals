## Abstract

Understanding the interaction of real- and reciprocal space topology in skyrmion crystals is an open problem.
We approach it from the viewpoint of $C^\ast$-algebras and calculate all admissible Chern numbers of a strongly coupled tight-binding skyrmion system on a triangular lattice as a function of Fermi energy and texture parameters. Our analysis reveals the topological complexity of electronic states coupled to spin textures, and the failure of the adiabatic picture to account for it in terms of emergent electromagnetism. On the contrary, we explain the discontinuous jumps in the real-space winding number in terms of collective evolution in real-, reciprocal, and mixed space Chern numbers. Our work sets the stage for further research on topological dynamics in complex dynamic spin textures coupled to external fields.

## About this repository

The repository is divided into three parts. 

1. `./code` contains the Python source code which sets up the spin Hamiltonian, constructs the Fermi projections, and evaluates the Chern numbers.
2. `./gfx/` contains both the data analysis and the data sets that went into the creation of the figures in the manuscript
3. `./tex` contains the LaTeX source for the manuscript itself and its Supplemental Material
