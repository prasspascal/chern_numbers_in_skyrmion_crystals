The data sets were produced using the python scripts `./code/run_real_space_phase_diagram.py` and `./code/run_real_space_phase_diagram.py` and can be found in `./gfx/figure_02/data/`.
To reproduce the data analysis use the python scripts `post_process_real_space_phase_diagram.py` and `post_process_real_space_phase_diagram_nz.py`.
