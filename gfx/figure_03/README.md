# Creating Figure 3

The data set were produced using the python scripts `./code/run_theta_kpm.py` and `./code/run_chern.py` and can be found in `./gfx/figure_03/data/`.
The respective input parameters were recorded in `*/params.json`.
To reproduce the data analysis use the Jupyter notebooks `DoS_theta_kpm.ipynb` and `Chern_Hierarchy.ipynb`.
