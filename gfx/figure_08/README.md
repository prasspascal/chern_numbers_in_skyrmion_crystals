# Creating Figure 8

The data set were produced using the python scripts `./code/run_theta_kpm.py` and `./code/run_chern_fermi.py` and can be found in `./gfx/figure_08/data/`.
The respective input parameters were recorded in `*/params.json`.
To reproduce the data analysis use the Jupyter notebooks `DoS+Chern_fermi_kpm_0shift07mag.ipynb`.
