# Creating Figure 9

The data set were produced using the python scripts `./code/run_shifts_kpm.py` and `./code/run_mags_kpm.py` and can be found in `./gfx/figure_09/data/`.
The respective input parameters were recorded in `*/params.json`.
To reproduce the data analysis use the Jupyter notebooks `DoS_transitions.ipynb`.
