# Creating Figure 10

The data sets were produced using the python scripts `./code/run_chern_shifts_ids.py`, `./code/run_chern_mags_ids.py`, and `./code/run_shifts.py` and can be found in `./gfx/figure_10/data/`.
The respective input parameters were recorded in `*/params.json`.
To reproduce the data analysis use the Jupyter notebooks the Jupyter notebooks `DoS+Chern_magnetisation_0shift.ipynb`, `DoS+Chern_phaseshift_0mag.ipynb`, and `DoS+Chern_phaseshift_07mag.ipynb`.
