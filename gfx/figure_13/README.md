# Creating Figure 13

The data set were produced using the python scripts `./code/run_chern_shifts_ids.py` and `./code/run_chern_mags_ids.py` and can be found in `./gfx/figure_13/data/`.
The respective input parameters were recorded in `*/params.json`.
To reproduce the data analysis use the Jupyter notebooks `DoS+Chern_magnetisation_0shift_reg01.ipynb`, `DoS+Chern_phaseshift_0mag_reg01.ipynb`, and `DoS+Chern_phaseshift_07mag_reg01.ipynb`.
