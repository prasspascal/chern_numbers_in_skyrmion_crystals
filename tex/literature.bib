  abstract   = {We demonstrate the emergence of an anomalous {Hall} effect in chiral magnetic textures which is neither proportional to the net magnetization nor to the well-known emergent magnetic field that is responsible for the topological {Hall} effect. Instead, it appears already at linear order in the gradients of the magnetization texture and exists for one-dimensional magnetic textures such as domain walls and spin spirals. It receives a natural interpretation in the language of Alain Connes’ noncommutative geometry. We show that this chiral {Hall} effect resembles the familiar topological {Hall} effect in essential properties while its phenomenology is distinctly different. Our findings make the reinterpretation of experimental data necessary, and offer an exciting twist in engineering the electrical transport through magnetic skyrmions.},

We used neutron scattering to observe the spontaneous formation of a two-dimensional lattice of skyrmion lines, a type of magnetic vortex, in the chiral itinerant-electron magnet MnSi. The skyrmion lattice stabilizes at the border between paramagnetism and long-range helimagnetic order perpendicular to a small applied magnetic field regardless of the direction of the magnetic field relative to the atomic lattice. Our study experimentally establishes magnetic materials lacking inversion symmetry as an arena for new forms of crystalline order composed of topologically stable spin states.}

The compound orders magnetically at TN=278.7 K into a long-range spiral (period approximately 683-700 AA) propagating along equivalent &lt;100&gt; directions at high temperatures and along equivalent &lt;111&gt; directions at low temperatures. The length of the spiral wavevector is nearly independent of temperature. The transition at TN is first order with very little hysteresis. The transition at which the direction of the spiral turns is rather sluggish. It takes place in a temperature interval of approximately 40 K and shows pronounced temperature hysteresis (T2 down arrow =211 K, T2 up arrow =245 K). Applied magnetic fields of 20-40 mT, depending on the temperature and the field direction, cause the spiral axis to turn into the direction of the applied field. As the field is further increased, the amplitude of the antiferromagnetic spiral decreases and the ferromagnetic component increases until at fields above approximately 200-300 mT cubic FeGe becomes magnetically saturated. The magnetic ordering in cubic FeGe is a Dzyaloshinskii spiral similar to the structure observed in the isostructural compound MnSi. However, in MnSi the spiral propagates along equivalent &lt;111&gt; directions at all temperatures below TN=29.5 K.}

abstract = {By considering the topological {Hall} conductivity and the nanoribbon edge states, i.e., the bulk-boundary correspondence of the skyrmion crystal (SkX), this work focused on the relation of the topological properties to the next-nearest-neighbor (nnn) hopping (t′), the exchange coupling strength (J), and the topological number of the skyrmion (Qsk). When the nnn hopping of the electrons coexists with the nearest-neighbor hopping, the flux pattern of the emergent magnetic field traversing the SkX is reshaped giving rise to different topological {Hall} effect. By increasing t′ from 0 to t, we found the Chern numbers of the electronic bands change from unity to indefinite values demonstrating a phase transition. By continually increasing Qsk from 1 to 2, we found topological phase transitions occur at Qsk=1.3 and 1.7. We also considered the effect of finite J and found the results obtained in the adiabatic limit (J≫t) hold to around J=t.}

abstract = {Topological insulators (TIs) are a class of materials which are insulating in their bulk form yet, upon introduction of an a boundary or edge, e.g. by abruptly terminating the material, may exhibit spontaneous current along their boundary. This property is quantified by topological indices associated with either the bulk or the edge system. In the field of condensed matter physics, tight binding (discrete) approximate models, parametrized by hopping coefficients, have been used successfully to capture the topological behavior of TIs in many settings. However, whether such tight binding models capture the same topological features as the underlying continuum models of quantum physics has been an open question. We resolve this question in the context of the archetypal example of topological behavior in materials, the integer quantum {Hall} effect. We study a class of continuum Hamiltonians, Hλ, which govern electron motion in a two-dimensional crystal under the influence of a perpendicular magnetic field. No assumption is made on translation invariance of the crystal. We prove, in the regime where both the magnetic field strength and depth of the crystal potential are sufficiently large, λ≫1, that the low-lying energy spectrum and eigenstates (and corresponding large time dynamics) of Hλ are well-described by a scale-free discrete Hamiltonian, HTB; we show norm resolvent convergence. The relevant topological index is the {Hall} conductivity, which is expressible as a Fredholm index. We prove that for large λ the topological indices of Hλ and HTB agree. This is proved separately for bulk and edge geometries. Our results justify the principle of using discrete models in the study of topological matter.}
